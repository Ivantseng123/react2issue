# Repo Re-select Back Button for Slack Triage Flow

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Status:** Approved
**Issue:** [#82](https://github.com/Ivantseng123/agentdock/issues/82)

## Problem

In the Slack interactive triage flow, after the user picks a repo (`action_id=repo_search` for external search or `repo_select_<N>` for button list), the flow immediately advances to the branch selector and — if needed — the description prompt. There is **no way to correct a mis-clicked repo** without abandoning the current thread and re-triggering `@bot`. Each abandoned flow costs the user thread re-parsing and re-attachment handling.

The user-facing pain is purely about conversational UX, not about AI triage quality. Quoting the issue: the main friction of the triage bot is not AI quality but "對話 UI 不友善".

## Goals

1. When the user has gone through a repo selector, every subsequent selector (branch, description) offers a `← 重新選 repo` button that returns the flow to a fresh repo selector.
2. The back action preserves the existing thread context (Slack messages, attachments resolution, reporter, channel metadata) — re-entering repo selection must not force the user to re-`@bot`.
3. No changes to Redis, job store, or any state beyond the in-memory `pending` map in `internal/bot/workflow.go`. The back action happens strictly before `runTriage` submits a job.
4. When the user triggered via the shortcut `@bot owner/repo[@branch]` or the channel has a single fixed repo (no selector was ever shown), the back button does NOT appear — clicking it would be nonsensical.

## Non-Goals

- Description modal back button. Once the modal opens, Slack's view lifecycle is separate; a back button there would require a different mechanism and is not requested.
- A global "reset" button that works at every step and clears the whole flow (issue's Option C). Scoped out; only the repo re-select flow from the issue.
- Re-selecting branch from the description step independently. If the user wants a different branch, they go back to repo (which re-triggers branch selection) — this keeps the single-axis "back to repo" semantic simple.
- Allowing back after `runTriage` has already submitted the job to the queue. The existing cancel button covers that.

## Design

### 1. Data Model

**`internal/bot/workflow.go`** — add one boolean to `pendingTriage`:

```go
type pendingTriage struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
    RepoWasPicked bool // true once the user has gone through a repo selector
}
```

Set by `HandleSelection` in the `case "repo", "repo_search":` branch immediately after a successful repo pick. Never reset. Governs whether downstream selectors render a back button.

No changes to `Job`, `JobState`, or any persisted struct. This flag lives only in the in-memory `pending` map.

### 2. Refactor — `slackAPI` Interface for Testability

**`internal/bot/workflow.go`** — introduce an unexported interface capturing the Slack methods `Workflow` uses, following the existing `SlackPoster` precedent in `result_listener.go`:

```go
type slackAPI interface {
    PostMessage(channelID, text, threadTS string) error
    PostMessageWithButton(channelID, text, threadTS, actionID, buttonText, value string) (string, error)
    PostSelector(channelID, prompt, actionPrefix string, options []string, threadTS string) (string, error)
    PostSelectorWithBack(channelID, prompt, actionPrefix string, options []string, threadTS string, backActionID, backLabel string) (string, error)
    PostExternalSelector(channelID, prompt, actionID, placeholder, threadTS string) (string, error)
    UpdateMessage(channelID, messageTS, text string) error
    OpenDescriptionModal(triggerID, selectorMsgTS string) error
    FetchThreadContext(channelID, threadTS, triggerTS, botUserID string, maxMsgs int) ([]slackclient.ThreadRawMessage, error)
    ResolveUser(userID string) string
    GetChannelName(channelID string) string
    DownloadAttachments(msgs []slackclient.ThreadRawMessage, tempDir string) []slackclient.AttachmentDownload
}
```

Change the struct field:

```go
type Workflow struct {
    // ...
    slack slackAPI // was *slackclient.Client
    // ...
}
```

`*slackclient.Client` satisfies the interface automatically — no changes to the constructor wiring in `cmd/agentdock/app.go`. Tests build a stub struct that implements the methods they exercise and return controllable errors.

Exact method signatures must match the current `slackclient.Client` methods; if any signature has drifted, update the interface accordingly during implementation.

### 3. Slack Client — `PostSelectorWithBack`

**`internal/slack/client.go`** — add a new function that wraps the existing `PostSelector` logic with an optional trailing back button:

```go
// PostSelectorWithBack sends a button selector with an optional trailing back button.
// If backActionID is empty, behaves identically to PostSelector.
func (c *Client) PostSelectorWithBack(
    channelID, prompt, actionPrefix string,
    options []string,
    threadTS string,
    backActionID, backLabel string,
) (string, error)
```

Implementation: reuse the existing `PostSelector` body, but after appending option buttons, if `backActionID != ""` append one more `slack.NewButtonBlockElement(backActionID, backLabel, ...)` **at the end** (rightmost in Slack's left-to-right render order). The back button uses default (grey) style — no `slack.StylePrimary` / `slack.StyleDanger`. All buttons share the same `actions` block.

Rationale for trailing position: maximum visual distance from the main option buttons minimizes accidental re-click (the issue's primary pain). Consistent with Slack's convention of placing secondary / escape actions after primary ones. Slack's 25-element limit per action block is not at risk (options lists are bounded by channel configs in practice).

`PostSelector` keeps its current signature and body untouched; `PostSelectorWithBack` is a net-new function. Existing callers of `PostSelector` are not modified.

### 4. Workflow — `HandleBackToRepo`

**`internal/bot/workflow.go`** — add:

```go
func (w *Workflow) HandleBackToRepo(channelID, selectorMsgTS string)
```

Behavior, in order:

1. **Lookup & lock.** Acquire `w.mu`, read `pt := w.pending[selectorMsgTS]`. If absent, release and return (a prior path already consumed it — silent no-op, consistent with `HandleSelection`).
2. **Delete old key.** `delete(w.pending, selectorMsgTS)` under the same lock, then unlock.
3. **Resolve channel config.** Same lookup as `HandleSelection` (fallback to `ChannelDefaults` if the channel is not explicitly configured).
4. **Clear carried-over fields.** `pt.SelectedRepo = ""`, `pt.SelectedBranch = ""`, `pt.ExtraDesc = ""`. Keep `RepoWasPicked=true` — the user has now gone through a repo selector twice, back should remain available on the next round.
5. **Post new repo selector FIRST** (via the extracted `postRepoSelector` helper — see §5 — or, if `len(repos) == 1`, auto-select and call `afterRepoSelected` directly instead). If the selector post fails, call `notifyError`, `clearDedup`, and return WITHOUT touching the old message (so the user still sees the original selector state and can retry manually by re-triggering `@bot`).
6. **Freeze old message.** Only after the new selector is posted: `UpdateMessage(channelID, selectorMsgTS, ":leftwards_arrow_with_hook: 已返回 repo 選擇")`.
7. **Register new pending entry.** `w.storePending(newSelectorTS, pt)` starts a fresh 1-minute timeout.

The old selector's 1-minute timeout goroutine will find its key missing and no-op — no extra cleanup needed.

### 5. Helper Extraction — `postRepoSelector`

Factor the repo-selector-posting logic out of `HandleTrigger` into a private method so `HandleBackToRepo` can reuse it:

```go
func (w *Workflow) postRepoSelector(pt *pendingTriage, channelCfg config.ChannelConfig) (string, error)
```

This helper covers **only the cases where a repo selector is actually posted**:
- `len(repos) > 1` → `pt.Phase = "repo"`, `PostSelector(... "repo_select" ...)`, return TS.
- `len(repos) == 0` → `pt.Phase = "repo_search"`, `PostExternalSelector(... "repo_search" ...)`, return TS.

**`len(repos) == 1` is NOT handled by this helper** — the name would lie. That case auto-selects without posting anything and is handled inline by the callers:

- `HandleTrigger`: already has the inline `len==1 → pt.SelectedRepo = repos[0]; afterRepoSelected(...); return` shortcut. Unchanged.
- `HandleBackToRepo` (rare case — channel config changed to single repo between `@bot` and back click): mirrors the inline pattern — `pt.SelectedRepo = repos[0]`, call `w.afterRepoSelected(pt, channelCfg)` directly. Does not call `postRepoSelector`.

This keeps the helper's name semantically honest ("post" means post) and puts the auto-select fallback in the two places where it's relevant.

### 6. Downstream Selectors — Gate on `RepoWasPicked`

**`afterRepoSelected`** (branch selector):

```go
backAction := ""
if pt.RepoWasPicked {
    backAction = "back_to_repo"
}
selectorTS, err := w.slack.PostSelectorWithBack(
    pt.ChannelID,
    fmt.Sprintf(":point_right: Which branch of `%s`?", pt.SelectedRepo),
    "branch_select", branches, pt.ThreadTS,
    backAction, "← 重新選 repo",
)
```

**`showDescriptionPrompt`**:

```go
backAction := ""
if pt.RepoWasPicked {
    backAction = "back_to_repo"
}
selectorTS, err := w.slack.PostSelectorWithBack(
    pt.ChannelID,
    ":memo: 需要補充說明嗎？（補充後可讓分析更精準）",
    "description_action", []string{"補充說明", "跳過"}, pt.ThreadTS,
    backAction, "← 重新選 repo",
)
```

No other call site of `PostSelector` is affected.

### 7. Router Wiring

**`cmd/agentdock/app.go`** — inside the `case slack.InteractionTypeBlockActions:` switch, add one case (ordering doesn't matter — all are mutually exclusive by `ActionID`):

```go
case action.ActionID == "back_to_repo":
    wf.HandleBackToRepo(cb.Channel.ID, selectorTS)
```

### 8. Logging

Follow `internal/logging/GUIDE.md` — component/phase taxonomy, Chinese messages, structured attrs:

- `HandleBackToRepo` entry: `pt.Logger.Info("收到返回 repo 請求", "phase", "接收", "from_selector_ts", selectorMsgTS)`
- Successful re-post: `pt.Logger.Info("已重新顯示 repo 選擇", "phase", "處理中", "new_selector_ts", newSelectorTS)`
- Re-post failure: `pt.Logger.Error("重選 repo 失敗", "phase", "失敗", "error", err)`

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `pending[selectorTS]` absent (double-click race, timeout-hit-first) | Silent return. Consistent with `HandleSelection`. |
| `postRepoSelector` returns error | `notifyError` + `clearDedup` so user can re-`@bot`. Old selector message is NOT frozen (user still sees the previous step). |
| `UpdateMessage` on old message fails after new selector posted | Log warn, proceed. User has the new selector in hand; a stale-looking old message is acceptable. |
| Channel config changed between trigger and back | Re-read `w.cfg.Channels[pt.ChannelID]` inside `HandleBackToRepo`. Mirrors existing workflow pattern. |
| Channel config changed so `len(repos) == 1` now | `HandleBackToRepo` auto-selects (`pt.SelectedRepo = repos[0]`) and calls `afterRepoSelected` directly, mirroring `HandleTrigger`'s shortcut. User sees a branch selector re-appear; acceptable for this rare race. |
| Description modal open + user clicks back on background message | `HandleDescriptionAction("補充說明")` leaves pt in pending so the modal submit can find it. `HandleBackToRepo` steals pt first; a subsequent modal submit hits `HandleDescriptionSubmit` → pending absent → silent return. User's typed description is dropped. Acceptable: they explicitly asked to change repo, so the description (bound to the previous repo context) is stale anyway. No special handling added. |
| Shortcut path (`@bot owner/repo[@branch]`) | `RepoWasPicked` stays false; back button never rendered; `HandleBackToRepo` never called. |
| Single-repo channel | Same as above — selector bypassed, flag stays false. |
| Channel with `branch_select: false` | `showDescriptionPrompt` called directly after repo pick; description selector carries back button if `RepoWasPicked=true`. |

## Testing

### Unit — `internal/bot/workflow_test.go` (new file — no existing workflow tests)

`workflow.go` currently has no test file. Adding `workflow_test.go` also requires the `slackAPI` interface refactor (§2) so tests can supply a stub. The stub struct records calls (method name + args) and returns configurable errors; tests assert against the recorded call log.

Planned tests:

- `TestHandleBackToRepo_FromBranchStep` — pending pt in `branch` phase with `RepoWasPicked=true`. Assert: old key deleted, new key present, `SelectedRepo`/`SelectedBranch` cleared, new repo selector posted, old message frozen.
- `TestHandleBackToRepo_FromDescriptionStep` — same with `Phase=description` and `ExtraDesc="existing"`. Assert: `ExtraDesc == ""` after back.
- `TestHandleBackToRepo_PendingNotFound` — empty pending map. Assert: no panic, no Slack calls.
- `TestHandleBackToRepo_PostSelectorFails_NoFreeze` — stub returns error for `PostSelector`/`PostExternalSelector`. Assert: `UpdateMessage` NOT called, error message posted via `notifyError`, `clearDedup` called.
- `TestHandleBackToRepo_ConfigNowSingleRepo` — channel config returns 1 repo when `HandleBackToRepo` runs. Assert: `postRepoSelector` not called, `afterRepoSelected` path taken, `pt.SelectedRepo` set to the single repo.
- `TestBranchSelector_HasBackButton_WhenRepoWasPicked` — set `pt.RepoWasPicked=true`, call `afterRepoSelected`. Assert: `PostSelectorWithBack` called with `backActionID="back_to_repo"`.
- `TestBranchSelector_NoBackButton_OnShortcut` — `pt.RepoWasPicked=false`. Assert: `backActionID==""`.
- `TestDescriptionPrompt_BackButtonGate` — both gate variants, same pattern as branch selector tests.

### No client_test.go additions

`internal/slack/client_test.go` currently tests only pure functions (no Slack HTTP mocking). `PostSelectorWithBack` block-structure correctness is covered transitively: the workflow stub asserts `PostSelectorWithBack` is called with correct `backActionID` / `backLabel` (semantic coverage), and any malformed block payload would surface immediately during manual QA as Slack's `invalid_blocks` error (per existing project landmine noted in `CLAUDE.md`).

### Integration / Manual QA

No router-level automated test (existing codebase has none for `cmd/agentdock/app.go` dispatch). PR description includes a Slack manual checklist:

1. Multi-repo channel: `@bot` → search dropdown → pick repo → branch selector shows back button → click back → repo search shows again, state clean.
2. Multi-repo channel: pick repo → pick branch → description prompt shows back button → click back → repo selector again, branch cleared.
3. Single-repo channel: `@bot` → branch selector has NO back button.
4. Shortcut `@bot owner/repo`: branch selector has NO back button.
5. Shortcut `@bot owner/repo@branch`: no selector at all (no regression).
6. Double-click back button: second click silently ignored (no error, no duplicate selector).
7. Back → wait 1 minute → "已超時" message appears.
8. Click "補充說明" to open modal, then click back on background message: subsequent modal submit does nothing; new repo selector is usable.

## Non-Instrumented

No Prometheus metric for back-click frequency. The change is pure UX affordance with no SLO or alerting signal, and dashboards are already focused on queue/agent telemetry. If the back-click rate becomes a quality signal later, add then.

## Rollout

Single PR. No config flag — the back button is uniformly beneficial and gated by `RepoWasPicked`, so channels where it shouldn't apply are automatically excluded.

No migration. `pendingTriage` lives in memory; existing in-flight triages unaffected because adding a field defaults to zero.

No version bump beyond the normal release-please patch.
