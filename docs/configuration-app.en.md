# App configuration (`app.yaml`)

[繁體中文](configuration-app.md)

YAML consumed by `agentdock app`. Default path: `~/.config/agentdock/app.yaml`. Run `agentdock init app -i` to generate a commented template.

## JobStore backend (`queue.store`)

The app tracks each Job's lifecycle (Pending → Running → Completed/Failed/Cancelled) via `JobStore`. `queue.store` picks where that state lives:

| Value | Behaviour | Recommended for |
|---|---|---|
| `redis` (default) | Persisted to Redis (`jobstore:*` keys). In-flight jobs survive app restarts. | Production, most deployments |
| `mem` | In-process memory. All state is lost when the app restarts. | Unit tests, single-pod local dev (when Redis persistence isn't needed) |

`queue.store_ttl` (default `1h`) is the per-record TTL applied by `RedisJobStore` on every Put / UpdateStatus / SetWorker / SetAgentStatus. Terminal-state jobs are not deleted proactively — TTL evicts them. Set the TTL comfortably larger than your **longest expected job runtime**; otherwise a slow job risks having its state evicted mid-run. Ignored when `store=mem` (MemJobStore runs its own 1h cleanup).

On startup with `store=redis`, the app calls `ListAll()` once and logs `rehydrated in-flight jobs from previous instance` with the count of non-terminal records. No in-memory index is rebuilt — `ResultListener` resolves jobs via `store.Get` directly against Redis.

**Expected Redis load**: switching to `store=redis` adds ~2 `store.Get` calls per worker StatusReport (default `worker.status_interval: 5s`) plus 1 `UpdateStatus` (WATCH/MULTI/EXEC round-trip) on state transitions. Roughly `0.6 × N` QPS per active worker — size your Redis accordingly; negligible for typical deployments.

Background / incident: [#123](https://github.com/Ivantseng123/agentdock/issues/123) (in-flight Slack jobs orphaned on app restart), [#146](https://github.com/Ivantseng123/agentdock/issues/146) (wire-up PR).

## Workflow-specific prompts

`prompt.issue` / `prompt.ask` / `prompt.pr_review` each carry their own `goal` + `response_schema` + `output_rules`:
- `goal` is the **task description** — what to do, which skill to invoke (`triage-issue` / `ask-assistant` / `github-pr-review`). Keep output format OUT of the goal.
- `response_schema` is the **machine-readable output contract** — marker + JSON shape (`===ASK_RESULT===` / `===REVIEW_RESULT===`, etc). This section is **NOT** XML-escaped in the rendered prompt — literal `"` and `<` reach the LLM verbatim, so weaker models don't copy `&quot;` into their output and break downstream JSON parsing.
- `output_rules` are **formatting rules** (Slack mrkdwn, length caps, self-reference handle) rendered at the end of the prompt, XML-escaped.
- Any unset field is filled from `app/config/defaults.go` (`defaultIssueGoal` / `defaultAskGoal` / `defaultPRReviewGoal` / `defaultIssueResponseSchema` / `defaultAskResponseSchema` / `defaultPRReviewResponseSchema` / `defaultAskOutputRules` / `defaultPRReviewOutputRules`). `issue.output_rules` defaults to empty — formatting rules live in the triage-issue skill's SKILL.md body template, not here.

**Legacy alias**: the flat `prompt.goal` / `prompt.output_rules` fields are copied into `prompt.issue.*` at load time, but only if `prompt.issue.*` is empty. This keeps pre-v2.1 yaml valid; new configs should write `prompt.issue.*` directly.

## PR Review

`pr_review.enabled` **defaults to `true`** (the `github-pr-review` skill and `agentdock pr-review-helper` subcommand both ship in the release image, so opt-in was just ceremony). To turn it off, set `pr_review.enabled: false` explicitly.

`@bot review <PR URL>` routes to PRReviewWorkflow; with no URL, the workflow scans the thread and falls back to a modal. Before relying on it, verify:
1. Workers have the `github-pr-review` skill mounted (their `skills_config` points to `agents/skills/github-pr-review`).
2. `agentdock pr-review-helper` is available on the worker host (built-in subcommand — keep app/worker binaries on the same version).
3. `secrets.GH_TOKEN` has enough permission to post review comments on the target PR.

## Log levels

Two independent knobs:

| Field | Sink | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `log_level` | console / stderr | `info` |
| `logging.level` | rotated file `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` | `debug` |

Accepts `debug` / `info` / `warn` / `error`. Also overridable via `--log-level` or the `LOG_LEVEL` env var.

## Secrets

In Redis mode, app owns all secrets and ships them encrypted to workers:

1. Configure `secret_key` (AES-256 key) and `secrets` (key-value map) in app.yaml.
2. On startup, app writes a beacon to Redis so workers can verify key equality.
3. On every submit, `secrets` gets AES-256-GCM encrypted into `Job.EncryptedSecrets`.
4. Worker decrypts and injects the values as env vars on the agent subprocess.

`github.token` is auto-merged into `secrets["GH_TOKEN"]`. `AGENTDOCK_SECRET_<NAME>` env vars are also slurped into `secrets`.

## Mantis (optional)

When a thread contains Mantis issue URLs (`view.php?id=` or `/issues/`), the agent calls the
bundled `mantis` skill to fetch issue title, description, and attachments. Config is two fields:

```yaml
mantis:
  base_url: https://mantis.example.com    # host root; no /api/rest suffix needed
  api_token: <your-mantis-api-token>
```

Both fields must be set, or both left empty — setting only one fails validation at startup.

**How it works**: on app startup, `base_url + /api/rest` is stored in `secrets["MANTIS_API_URL"]`
and `api_token` goes into `secrets["MANTIS_API_TOKEN"]`. The worker forwards both as env vars
when spawning the agent subprocess. The bundled `mantis` skill reads those env vars; the agent
invokes the skill whenever it sees a Mantis URL in the thread context.

**Basic auth removed**: the bundled skill only supports API token auth. If your Mantis version
is too old for API tokens, upgrade Mantis or leave the `mantis` block empty (skill disabled).

**When unconfigured**: the agent still sees Mantis URLs in the thread, but does not fetch issue
content — URLs pass through to the GitHub issue body as-is.

**Worker host prerequisite**: the worker needs Node.js 18+ to execute the JS in the bundled
mantis skill. The official Docker image already includes it.
